# Molecular-Structure-Generator
Takes user input for the IUPAC name of any compound and generates a 2D and a 3D structure of the said compound.


The prerequisites are:
1. Preferrably latest Python Software
2. Jupyter Notebook/cell for the 3D structure to be generated.
3. Pip and Pip modules installed:
(pip install rdkit),(pip install pubchempy),(pip install py3Dmol),(pip install notebook)
4. Knowledge of IUPAC Nomenclature Rules

Limitations:
1. May generate errors if given a complicated compound.
2. 3D structures are slow to generate.
3. Has to be done in a Jupyter Notebook/cell for the 3D structure to be generated.
